## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings & Prerequisites

### üö® DLL Initialization Issues
**You may encounter DLL initialization failures** when running this application, especially on Windows. This is a common issue with the underlying audio libraries.

**Solutions:**
1. Install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
2. If issues persist, run the application multiple times - it often resolves after the first few attempts
3. Check that all dependencies are properly installed in your virtual environment

### üìã Prerequisites

#### 1. External System Dependencies
- **FFmpeg** - Required by Whisper for audio processing
  - **Windows/macOS/Linux:** Install FFmpeg and ensure it's in your system PATH
- **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable** - For Windows audio support

#### 2. Python Environment Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. AI Models (Auto-downloaded)
- **Whisper Model (STT)** - Uses 'small' model (downloads automatically ~40MB)
- **Piper Model (TTS)** - Uses 'en_US-amy-medium' voice (downloads automatically ~60MB)

## üöÄ How to Run

### Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)
```bash
python web_app.py
```
- Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
- Click "Start Recording" to begin speech recognition
- View transcriptions in real-time
- Use "Speak" button for text-to-speech

### Option 2: Desktop GUI
```bash
python voice_gui.py
```
- PyQt5 interface for desktop use
- Same functionality as web app in a native window

- **"Ready"** - Waiting for input

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Modular Design
- **`audio.py`** - Audio recording and processing
- **`stt.py`** - Speech-to-text using Whisper
- **`tts.py`** - Text-to-speech using Piper
- **`web_app.py`** - Flask web application
- **`voice_gui.py`** - PyQt5 desktop interface

### Key Features
- **Real-time Status Updates** - Live feedback during all operations
- **Persistent Sessions** - Previous transcriptions remain visible
- **STT-Only Mode** - No automatic TTS after transcription
- **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of audio/processing errors

## üîß Recent Updates

### Version 2.0 - Major Improvements

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### DLL Initialization Failures
```
Error: DLL load failed
```
**Solutions:**
1. Install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
2. Try running the application multiple times
3. Ensure you're using the virtual environment

#### Audio Device Issues
```
Error: Audio device not found
```
**Solutions:**
1. Check microphone permissions
2. Verify audio drivers are installed
3. Try different audio devices in system settings

#### Model Download Issues
```
Error: Model download failed
```
**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Models download automatically on first run
3. Ensure sufficient disk space (~100MB for models)

#### Transcription Not Displaying
```
Backend shows transcription but web interface doesn't update
```
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Ensure `/api/status` endpoint is accessible
3. Verify real-time polling is working

### Performance Tips
- Use the 'small' Whisper model for better performance
- Close other applications that use audio/microphone
- Ensure sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended)
